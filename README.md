## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### **1. Clone the Project Repository**

Clone the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Werbster-MT/chat-bot-ufc-ask.git
```

### **2. Switch to the Development Branch**

Once you have cloned the repository, switch to the `development` branch to work on the latest development version:

```bash
git checkout development
```

### **3. Create a New Branch for Your Feature**

To ensure good project organization, create a new branch from `development` for your specific feature or bug fix. More about branching can be found in the [branching guidelines](branching_guideline.md).

```bash
git checkout -b [your-branch-name]
```

### **4. Install Dependencies**

If this is your first time working with the project, you will need to install the project dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

### **5. Run the Application**

To run the application with automatic reloading, use `nodemon`. This will watch for file changes and restart the server:

```bash
nodemon index.js
```

If you prefer to run the application without automatic reloading, simply use:

```bash
node index.js
```
